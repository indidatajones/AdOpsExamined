Online publishers rely heavily on digital ad operations companies for revenue generation. After all, what good is a quality website if it’s not making you any money? If your primary source of revenue is through advertisements and you seek the most cost effective option then the importance of DAO is even greater to you.

### What is Digital Ad Operations?

Digital Ad Operations (DAO) refers to the systems and processes that support the management and delivery of advertisements through digital mediums. These are, but not limited to: websites, email banner ads, SMS, apps, etc.

DAO can also be considered as a department that is directly responsible for revenue generation through ad campaigns.

### Ad Operations Aspects

Ad operations involve different kinds of tasks:

* **Trafficking:** As the name suggests, it involves monitoring and delivery across ad exchanges, tracking 3rd party ad tags from different vendors, and also performing troubleshooting when necessary.
* **Scheduling:** Timing of ads also plays an important part in the success of an ad campaign. Thus, some ads are made active for certain hours of a day, and others for different. For instance, special days such as holidays, weekends, etc. also contribute towards efficient Ad scheduling.
* **Optimization:** Ads needs to be polished, SEO optimized, and altered according to the trends and changing standards. There are many other factors that improve the CTC (cost to click) factor, which include the location of the banners itself. Depending on the layout of a certain website some spots on the pages may suit better for the ad displays than others.

### Ad Publishing and Campaign Management

  > "Good Advertising does not just circulate information. It penetrates the public mind with desires and belief."

Successful ad campaigns demand careful planning, and calculated actions. The following are the basic steps for a good campaign:

1. Setting the Objective: Before starting anything it is important to have a clear goal associated with the campaign. Is it increased revenue? Is it brand promotion? Is it both? Unless this is established you must not proceed further.
2. Selecting Media for Message Delivery: There are a lot of platforms for reaching the target audience: email banners, social media, video content based websites, etc. Depending on the ad message the most suitable medium has to be decided.
3. Creating the Message: The entire campaign should be centred around one strong message, which also should be very clear.
4. Evaluating Results and Making Changes: Post the release of a campaign the results have to be analyzed, and used for reconfiguring the campaign.

### Keywords and Optimization

With the multitude of websites rising in all kinds of niches today, it is becoming harder and harder to stand out from the rest. The same has also made keyword optimization super important for any ad campaign.

Say, if you are using Google Adwords for your advertisement campaign, then you can use the following optimization techniques:
Learning and Adapting: It is most unlikely for anyone to start with a perfect ad campaign. In most cases you will need to get back to the drawing board again and again. Suppose you started with this ad group:

Cheap iPhones
Low price iPhones
Affordable iPhones
Discounted iPhones
After a week you analyze the results and notice that the keywords “cheap” and “low price” have got the maximum click-rate. You can thus focus on them now. The new ad group could be something like:
Cheap original iPhones
New iPhones at Cheap prices
Affordable iPhones for cheap
Discounted cheap iPhones

###vMobile Optimization

Mobiles have become the primary devices used by the people for accessing Internet. The mobile phone Internet user penetration is also increasing by each passing day.

It's important that you optimize your ads for mobile devices too, as they have smaller screens that won’t work well for large banner ads. A good way to optimize for mobiles is to use anchor ads that are provided by Google AdSense. These ads anchor to the bottom of the mobile screen when the user scrolls up or down.
